# Formal Verification Exercises (Dafny)
My solutions to the exercises from the [University of Michigan's EECS 498: Formal Verification](https://glados-michigan.github.io/verification-class/fall2024/) course.

## Overview
This repository covers the fundamentals of formal verification using the **Dafny** language, progressing from basic functional correctness to proving safety and refinement of distributed systems.

## Course Structure
- 📚 **Chapter 1: Dafny Basics**
    - Pre/Post conditions, assertions
- 📚 **Chapter 2: Specification**
    - Lemmas, functions vs methods, datatypes
- 📚 **Chapter 3: State Machines**
    - Init, Next, safety properties
- 📚 **Chapter 4: Invariants**
    - Inductive invariants, strengthening
- 📚 **Chapter 5: Distributed State Machines**
    - Network models, asynchrony
- 🏆 **Project 1: Distributed Lock Server**
    - Safety proofs, asynchronous token passing, epoch-based consistency
- 📚 **Chapter 6: Refinement**
    - Abstraction layers
- 🏆 **Project 2: Sharded Key-Value Store**
    - Refinement proofs, disjoint memory modeling
